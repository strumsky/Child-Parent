Discussion Questions

1.Yes, this is not a god use of Object oriented programming it can be improved. With the use of
the filter and the sponge the breakdown can be made even more by reducing the amount of lines of ouput that will occur.

2.I might allow a kill command that sends a signal to small program that stops all processes
that are in order and even might run it in the background.

3.To handle a child process that terminates before a parent process destroys it can be dealt by 
having a check at the end of the program that checks for the child or we can have a type of pointer that will
be connected to the child for this purpose alone, which will allow us to take in information that we might
need from the child process.

I have tried to implement the sponge idiom
